# NA Task Auto-Hide Feature Implementation

## Summary
This implementation adds timestamp tracking for tasks marked as NA (Not Applicable), allowing them to automatically hide from the task list the next day, just like completed tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Database Migration
- **File**: `/backend/migrations/001_add_na_marked_at.sql`
- **Change**: Added `na_marked_at` TIMESTAMP column to `tasks` table
- **Status**: ✅ Migration completed successfully

#### Model Update
- **File**: `/backend/app/models/models.py`
- **Change**: Added `na_marked_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)` field to Task model
- **Purpose**: Track the timestamp when a task is marked as NA

#### Schema Update
- **File**: `/backend/app/models/schemas.py`
- **Change**: Added `na_marked_at: Optional[datetime] = None` to TaskResponse schema
- **Purpose**: Include the field in API responses

#### Service Logic Update
- **File**: `/backend/app/services/task_service.py`
- **Changes**:
  - When `is_active` changes from `True` to `False`: Set `na_marked_at = datetime.utcnow()`
  - When `is_active` changes from `False` to `True`: Clear `na_marked_at = None`
- **Purpose**: Automatically track when tasks are marked/unmarked as NA

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Type Definition Updates
- **File**: `/frontend/src/types/index.ts`
- **Change**: Added `na_marked_at?: string` to Task interface
- **Purpose**: TypeScript type safety for the new field

#### Tasks Page Interface Update
- **File**: `/frontend/src/pages/Tasks.tsx` (line 12-26)
- **Change**: Added `na_marked_at?: string` to local Task interface
- **Purpose**: Support the new field in the component

#### Filtering Logic Update
- **File**: `/frontend/src/pages/Tasks.tsx` (line 108-123)
- **Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // If task is marked as NA (inactive), only show if marked today
  if (!task.is_active && task.na_marked_at) {
    const naMarkedDate = new Date(task.na_marked_at);
    naMarkedDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
    return naMarkedDate.getTime() === today.getTime();
  }
  ```
- **Purpose**: Filter out NA tasks that were marked on previous days

## How It Works

### When a Task is Marked as NA:
1. User clicks the "NA" button on a task
2. Frontend calls `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` with `is_active: false`
3. Backend service detects the status change and automatically sets `na_marked_at = current_timestamp`
4. Task row displays with gray background
5. Total time calculation excludes the task

### Next Day Auto-Hide:
1. When tasks page loads, filtering logic checks all tasks
2. For completed tasks: Only show if `completed_at` date equals today
3. For NA tasks: Only show if `na_marked_at` date equals today
4. Tasks marked NA yesterday will be filtered out automatically

### If Task is Reactivated:
1. If a task's `is_active` changes back to `True`
2. Backend automatically clears `na_marked_at` to `null`
3. Task will be shown in the list again

## Testing the Feature

### Test Case 1: Mark Task as NA
1. Navigate to Today tab
2. Click "NA" button on an active task
3. **Expected**: Task row turns gray, total time updates
4. **Verify**: Task's `na_marked_at` field is set in database

### Test Case 2: Next Day Auto-Hide
1. Mark a task as NA today
2. Wait until the next day (or manually change system date)
3. Refresh the tasks page
4. **Expected**: NA task from yesterday is not visible
5. **Expected**: NA tasks marked today are still visible

### Test Case 3: Completed Tasks Still Work
1. Mark a task as completed today
2. **Expected**: Task row turns green, shows "✓ Completed"
3. Next day: Task should not be visible
4. **Expected**: Completed tasks from yesterday are filtered out

### Test Case 4: Reactivate NA Task
1. Through API, update a NA task to set `is_active: true`
2. **Expected**: `na_marked_at` is cleared
3. **Expected**: Task appears in the list again

## Database Verification

### Check if migration ran successfully:
```bash
cd backend
sqlite3 database/mytimemanager.db "PRAGMA table_info(tasks);"
# Look for: 20|na_marked_at|TIMESTAMP|0||0
```

### Check tasks with NA timestamp:
```bash
sqlite3 database/mytimemanager.db "SELECT id, name, is_active, na_marked_at FROM tasks WHERE na_marked_at IS NOT NULL;"
```

## API Endpoint Behavior

### When marking task as NA:
```bash
# Request
PUT /api/tasks/{id}
{
  "is_active": false
}

# Response includes:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Task Name",
  "is_active": false,
  "na_marked_at": "2025-10-22T10:30:00.000Z",
  ...
}
```

### When reactivating task:
```bash
# Request
PUT /api/tasks/{id}
{
  "is_active": true
}

# Response includes:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Task Name",
  "is_active": true,
  "na_marked_at": null,
  ...
}
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Consistent Behavior**: NA tasks now behave exactly like completed tasks
2. **Clean UI**: Task list stays clean and focused on current items
3. **Data Preservation**: Historical data is preserved in database
4. **Reactivation Support**: Tasks can be unmarked as NA and reappear
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for the new field
6. **Automatic Tracking**: Timestamps are set automatically, no manual intervention needed

## Long-term Maintenance

- Database has proper timestamp field for historical analysis
- Can implement reporting on NA tasks over time
- Can add filters to view historical NA tasks if needed
- Consistent with completed_at field pattern for maintainability
