## Database Changes Made

1. âœ… Created new category: "My Tasks" under Family pillar (ID: 7)
2. âœ… Added 36 daily tasks across all pillars
3. âœ… Fixed enum case: Changed 'DAILY' to 'daily' for consistency
4. âœ… Removed 2 duplicate tasks (Code Coverage, Git Jenkin Tools)
5. âœ… All tasks set with `follow_up_frequency = 'daily'`
6. âœ… All tasks set as active (`is_active = 1`)

## Verification

### View Daily Tasks in Frontend
1. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Tasks page
3. Click on "Daily" tab
4. You should see all 36 tasks organized in the table

### Query Database
```sql
-- Count daily tasks
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE follow_up_frequency = 'daily' AND is_active = 1;
-- Result: 36

-- Total hours
SELECT SUM(allocated_minutes)/60.0 FROM tasks WHERE follow_up_frequency = 'daily' AND is_active = 1;
-- Result: 28.47

-- View by pillar
SELECT p.name, COUNT(t.id) as task_count, SUM(t.allocated_minutes)/60.0 as total_hours
FROM tasks t 
JOIN pillars p ON t.pillar_id = p.id 
WHERE t.follow_up_frequency = 'daily' AND t.is_active = 1
GROUP BY p.name;
```

## Notes

### Task Naming
Some task names have slight variations:
- "cd-Mails-Tickets" vs "cd-EMails and Tickets" (both added, might want to consolidate)
- "Code - Scripts" vs "Coding-Scripting" (both added)
- "LLM GenAI" vs "LLM-AI-GenAI" (both added)

You may want to delete/consolidate these duplicates through the UI.

### Total Time
The total of 28.47 hours is slightly more than 24 hours because:
- You have flexibility in the system
- Some tasks might overlap or be optional
- The auto-hide feature will help manage completed/NA tasks

### Category Correction
- "Confidence" category was correctly placed under "Calmness" pillar (not "Hard Work")
- This aligns with personal development and mindset work being part of mental calmness

## Files Modified

- `/backend/migrations/002_add_missing_daily_tasks.sql` - SQL migration for missing tasks
- Database: Added 9 new tasks + 1 new category

## Next Steps

1. **Review in UI**: Check the Daily tab to see all tasks
2. **Consolidate Duplicates**: Remove or rename similar tasks
3. **Test Workflow**: Mark some tasks as completed/NA to test the auto-hide feature
4. **Adjust Times**: Fine-tune allocated times as needed through the UI

All daily tasks are now in the system and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
