```

### Environment Configuration

The `.env` file contains important settings:

## üéØ Development Approach

We're building this **step-by-step** to avoid bugs and circular dependencies:

1. ‚úÖ Project structure and configuration
2. ‚è≥ Database and models (Next)
3. ‚è≥ Three pillars system
4. ‚è≥ Task management
5. ‚è≥ Goal management
6. ‚è≥ Dashboards and analytics
7. ‚è≥ UI/UX enhancements

Each milestone will be:
- Fully tested
- Committed to git
- Merged to main branch
- Documented
